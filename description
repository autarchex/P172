This system is an audiovisual ambiance tool for a Tiki-themed bar.  It plays the sound of thunder, followed by rain, and synchronized flashing white lights to simulate lightning, at the press of a button.

System controller is a Raspberry Pi Model 1 A+.  This was selected for its power efficiency, and because unlike some Rpi models which are even lower power, it retains the HDMI and audio output ports of its bigger brothers.

Peripheral devices are:

1. Analog audio, on audio output port, to a pair of USB-powered PC speakers.
2. A button input, on GPIO.  Electrically this consists of a button on the case parallel-connected to a connector for a remote button for installation convenience.
3. A light-enable output, on GPIO.  Electrically this is split into two parallel-connected, 2-conductor cable connectors, which carry ground and enable signal to the lighting controllers.
4. A "wi-pi" USB wireless LAN dongle, on the sole USB-A port.
5. Power input, on the USB-micro port.  The power is expected to come from a USB charger brick shared with the speakers.

GPIO is 3.3V logic.  Inputs are configured to use internal pullups and therefore sense active-low signals.

System will be configured to be 'headless' - i.e., without monitor or keyboard.  Given the lack of ethernet port and single USB device port, this necessitates use of a Wi-fi dongle for programming updates.

PLAN:
- configure Rpi to produce an access point on its wlan0 port when present.
-- This AP will be named "CloudLightning"
-- user: pi
-- pass: to be determined, certainly not written down here.

- configure DHCP on this wireless access point.
-- This will allow me to login via SSH whenever updates or maintenance are required.
