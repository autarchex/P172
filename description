This system is an audiovisual ambiance tool for a Tiki-themed bar.  It plays the sound of thunder, followed by rain, and synchronized flashing white lights to simulate lightning, at the press of a button.

System controller is a Raspberry Pi Model 3.  I originally selected a model A+, for its power efficiency, and because unlike some Rpi models which are even lower power, it retains the HDMI and audio output ports of its bigger brothers.  However I desired remote login capability and like the original RPi boards, this one has trouble powering my USB wifi dongle.  I switched to a model 3 which has built-in wifi.  The RPi 3 is set up to operate its wifi as an access point, to which a laptop can connect and then administrate wirelessly (ssh pi@ThunderCloud.local).  If a wifi dongle is inserted, it can also access the internet in case any software ever needs to be updated, but the wifi dongle will not be present during normal operation.

Peripheral devices are:

1. Analog audio, on audio output port, to a pair of USB-powered PC speakers.
2. A button input, on GPIO.  Electrically this consists of a button on the case parallel-connected to a connector for a remote button for installation convenience.
3. Two light-enable outputs, on GPIO, which which carry ground and enable signals to the lighting controllers over two 2-conductor cables.  Presently the software toggles these two in parallel.
4. Power input, on the USB-micro port.  The power is expected to come from a USB charger brick shared with the speakers.

GPIO is 3.3V logic.  Inputs are configured to use internal pullups and therefore sense active-low signals.

A systemd service automatically runs the control program on boot.  System requires roughly 20 seconds to boot up, express its access point, and respond to button press inputs.

System is configured to be 'headless' - i.e., without monitor or keyboard, and without exposed ports other than for power and audio.  This necessitates use of a laptop with wifi for programming updates.  Connect to the RPi's wireless access point:

Wireless SSID: Thundercloud
Wireless pass: *** (see credentials file)
subnet is 192.168.42.0
dhcp hands out IP addresses 192.168.42.10 and above

hostname: ThunderCloud
domain: .local

primary user name: pi
primary user pass: *** (see credentials file)
backup user: autarchex

The control program and its dependencies are located in /home/pi/thunder/ .
