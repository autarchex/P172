Setting up automatic run of my script on boot.
I followed a guide at www.dexterindustries.com/howto/run-a-program-on-your-raspberry-pi-at-startup/
Here are the steps I followed. I created a systemd service called thunder, which executes script thundercloud.py.  All filenames used by that script must be fully specified, as it is root that will be running the script.


sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/thunder.service
-------------
[Unit]
Description=ThunderCloud Service
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/thunder/thundercloud.py

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
--------------

This describes a service that will run after the multi-user environment becomes available.
The Type=idle bit means run it only after everything else has loaded.

Permission on the unit file needs to be 644:
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/thunder.service

Now tell systemd to use it during boot sequence:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable thunder.service

sudo reboot


The service can be checked by doing
service thunder status

It can be stopped by doing
sudo service thunder stop
